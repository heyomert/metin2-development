### ⬇️ Obtaining the Serverfiles

First things first, find a folder of your choosing where you will be cloning the Serverfiles project (server). In your terminal, `cd` into that location and download the project using `git`.

<details>
  <summary>
    Here's how
  </summary>

  <br>

  >
  > <br>
  >
  >
  > This example will use `/usr/home/game` as the working directory.
  >
  > Execute these commands:
  >
  > ```
  > mkdir /usr/home/game
  > cd /usr/home/game
  > git clone https://github.com/d1str4ught/m2dev-server.git .
  > ```
  > Mind the `.` in the end of the last command.
  >
  > With the `.`, the project will be cloned right in `/usr/home/game`, while without it, it will be cloned as `/usr/home/game/m2dev-server`.
  >
  > This is just a preference, either way is fine.

### 🛻 Getting everything in the right place

Before getting into the actual configuration of the files, it is very important that you get your **compiled binaries** into the right places.

**If you haven't compiled the Server Source yet, you should pause here, compile everything and come back to this point**!

<details>
  <summary>
    After your builds are done
  </summary>

  <br>

  >
  > <br>
  >
  > What you need to do is distribute the built binaries in their respective locations within the **Server** project and assign full system permissions (`0777`). You will find the built binaries in the `server-src/build` folder:
  > - game
  > - db
  > - qc
  >
  > First, `cd` into that directory and then execute these commands (**replace the directories with your own structure!!!**):
  >
  > ```
  > cd /usr/home/src/build/bin
  >
  > cp ./game /usr/home/game/share/bin/game
  > chmod 777 /usr/home/game/share/bin/game
  >
  > cp ./db /usr/home/game/share/bin/db
  > chmod 777 /usr/home/game/share/bin/db
  >
  > cp ./qc /usr/home/game/share/locale/english/quest/qc
  > chmod 777 /usr/home/game/share/locale/english/quest/qc
  > ```
  > **Note**: For `qc`, replace `english` with your locale if you have changed it.
  >
  > <br>
  >
  > #### You should now have the following files in their respective directories with full system permissions assigned:
  > - `/usr/home/game/share/bin/game`
  > - `/usr/home/game/share/bin/db`
  > - `/usr/home/game/share/locale/english/quest/qc`
  >
  > <br>
  >
  > ### ✅ You have distributed your built binaries to their destination directories!
  >
  > <br>
  >
</details>

<br>

### 🛠️ Building the quests

This step is gonna be extremely easy and most of you are very familiar with it.

<details>
  <summary>
    Here's what to do
  </summary>

  <br>

  >
  > <br>
  >
  > First, `cd` into the destination directory of your `qc` built binary:
  > ```
  > cd /usr/home/game/share/locale/english/quest
  > ```
  >
  > Next, run the `make.py` file to execute the `qc` and build all your quests:
  >
  > ```
  > python make.py
  > ```
  >
  > **WARNING**: You need to **first `cd` into the quests folder** before executing the `make.py` script!
  > Commands like:
  > ```
  > python /usr/home/game/share/locale/english/quest/make.py
  > ```
  > **will result in errors!**
  > 
  > This happens because when you `cd` in a folder you are changing the `cwd` (current working directory). If your `cwd` is not the `quest` folder, the `make.py` script will not be able to find your quests and hence, an error will appear.
  >
  > <br>
  >
  > After `qc` has done its job, your terminal should be looking like this:

### 📊 Importing the databases and tables

If you've configured your database correctly in the Server Source part and you can successfully connect to your root account with your terminal or/end your database management software (Navicat), then this process is gonna be very easy.

<details>
  <summary>
    The process
  </summary>

  <br>

  >
  > <br>
  >
  > There's 5 different databases that you need to import into your MariaDB/MySQL Server:
  > - `account`
  > - `common`
  > - `hotbackup` (empty database, needs to simply exist)
  > - `log`
  > - `player`
  >
  > <br>
  >
  > You have 2 options to import these databases and their tables
  >
  > #### **1. Terminal**
  > First, you need to create the 5 databases before importing their tables and data.
  >
  > In your terminal type these commands:
  >
  > ```
  > CREATE DATABASE account;
  > CREATE DATABASE common;
  > CREATE DATABASE player;
  > CREATE DATABASE log;
  > CREATE DATABASE hotbackup;
  > exit;
  > ```
  >
  > <br>
  >
  > Next, in your `/usr/home/game/sql` (or wherever you installed the serverfiles) you have some `*.sql` files (`account.sql`, `common.sql`, etc...).
  >
  > You can use these files to import everything with a simple command.
  >
  > First `cd` into the `/sql` folder:
  >
  > ```
  > cd /usr/home/game/sql
  > ```
  >
  > and then:
  >
  > ```
  > mysql -u root -p account < account.sql
  > mysql -u root -p common < common.sql
  > mysql -u root -p log < log.sql
  > mysql -u root -p player < player.sql
  > ```
  >
  > <br>
  >
  > If you open up your MariaDB connection in Navicat, your tables should be now visible!
  >
  > ![](https://metin2.download/picture/Qnbap61LLK49vi7PJ7uW9kEN42bJq3i1/.png)
  >
  > <br>
  >
  > #### **2. Navicat (database management software)**
  >
  > In Navicat, double click your connection to open it. Next, select **New Database...**
  >
  > ![](https://metin2.download/picture/PCIQDqd3x2q5wdCLg9cFQ0XT0UL77e0b/.png)

  > A dialog will popup, there enter the name of your database name (e.g., `account`) in **Database Name** and make sure that **Character Set** is set to `utf8mb4` for all cases.
  >
  > ![](https://metin2.download/picture/1UFgAAZjanT10IW2pTRawj7VrIH61Es4/.png)
  >
  > Do that for all 5 databases:
  > - `account`
  > - `common`
  > - `hotbackup`
  > - `log`
  > - `player`
  >
  > <br>
  >
  > Next, double click in a database to open it. It should turn green. Once it's open, right click on it and select **Execute SQL File...**
  >
  > ![](https://metin2.download/picture/77faDy05FMqLx9qR2qY9pdHlu0RcgwTu/.png)
  >
  > A dialog will popup, leave all checkboxes to the default values and click the **...** button to browse through your file system (**the `sql` files need to be downloaded from the VM to your physical drive**) and select the file. Once selected, click **Start** and wait for the process to finish.
  >
  > ![](https://metin2.download/picture/8yP6ukLyCZJhC9r9v7VSUsd955hGygXM/.png)
  >
  > Once this pops up, you can click **Close**.

  > ![](https://metin2.download/picture/mF72tgh77NDiZ200Do8dtZxTeinJ4U29/.png)
  >
  > <br>
  >
  > Make sure you repeat this process for all created databases (you can skip `hotbackup`)
  > 
  > <br>
  >
  > If you right click and hit **Refresh** in the empty space, you should be seeing all your tables.

## Basic server management scripts
Below is a little list of what the scripts inside the root folder of the project do. The names are pretty self-explanatory but here they are anyway:

 - `start.py` starts the selected number of channels
 - `stop.py` stops all channel instances and the database
 - `install.py` installs the channels and links the folders inside `share` to each channel core
 - `clear.py` clears all logs from every channel core (`pid.json`, `syserr.log`, `syslog.log`, any `.core` files as well as the `log` folder)
 - `channels.py` dependency of `install.py`, running it doesn't do anything
 - `perms.py` (Linux only) assigns full permissions to the binaries (`game`, `db` and `qc`)

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

## Recap
After finishing this part, you should now have knowledge of:

 - The base structure of the serverfiles
 - Creating and populaing MariaDB databases and tables through `sql` scripts using the terminal/command line or Navicat's interface
 - Building the quests
 - Managing the server (starting/stopping/clearing/installing)

<br>

## 🔥 Your server is now live!

<br>

## Next steps
After following either the **FreeBSD** method or the **Windows** method, you should be ready to proceed to cloning, building and distributing the [Client Source project](https://github.com/d1str4ught/m2dev-client-src)
